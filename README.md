# ***NguhRoutes*** mod
This is the mod version of NguhRoutes. You can find the website [here](https://nguhroutes.viklo.workers.dev/) and the git repo for the website [here](https://github.com/therealviklo/nguhroutes-website). It is currently pretty basic but it can give you a route to a station and tell you where you need to go next. It fetches the data for the network and routes from the website.

**If you don't want to compile it yourself, go to releases on the side and download the jar from there.** Note that the mod requires you to have the Kotlin support installed, which you probably have for the main Nguhcraft mod, but you may have to get a newer version. If there is a such an issue it will give you an error when you try to launch.

The main command is `/nguhroutes`, with a shortcut `/nr`, and there is also `/nrs` as a shortcut for `/nguhroutes start`. If you don't want to include routes that cross into the Nether, do `/nguhroutes reload nonether`.
